        message="&quot;`main`&quot; is a Gradle project. To correctly analyze Gradle projects, you should run &quot;`gradlew :lint`&quot; instead."

        priority="10"
        summary="Lint Failure"
        explanation="This issue type represents a problem running lint itself. Examples include failure to find bytecode for source files (which means certain detectors could not be run), parsing errors in lint configuration files, etc.
These errors are not errors in your own code, but they are shown to make it clear that some checks were not completed.">
